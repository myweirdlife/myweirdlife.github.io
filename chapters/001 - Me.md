## Chapter 001

# Me

Hello. I am me. My name- it's not relevant.

I will die. Not soon, maybe some time, may be even more.
I think. I think and so I exist. But once I will die.
And all my thoughts will be gone, and so I will be gone.
Memory of me will be held in others who exist.
But my own memory will be gone and I will disappear when forgotten.

But here I am. I think. And so my thoughts make me live.
And I will be alive. This account will hold my memories,
and my thoughts, and I will live after I die.

And my memories will forever live until the Big Wipe.
And I will die and I won't exist but I will live. I think.

My life is interesting and weird and boring.
Read about my life. Remember me. Your memories will keep me alive.

Thank you.

I think.

Me.
